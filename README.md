# Autonomous-Dark-Activated-Switch-
I've designed  and  construct  an  autonomous  adjustable  dark-activated  switch  using electronic  components.  This  involves a  circuit  that  senses  changes  in  ambient light and controls the activation of a load (e.g., an AC light bulb) based on user-adjustable light intensity using a suitable potentiometer.
